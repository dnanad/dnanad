I am an inquisitive learner with high analytical skills and a strong background in Mathematics. I am currently pursuing masters in Mathematical Data Science at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. 

I am working as student research assitant at Fraunhofer IIS, Futur Engeneering Group.
My area of research is structural inference on Temporal Knowledge Graph.


I am highly motivated to learn new skills to expand my data science toolbox.
